            | JDBC -> Java Database Connectivity |
            --------------------------------------
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that lets your Java code talk to a database.
```
It gives you classes & interfaces to:
            📡 Connect to a database.
            📄 Send SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
            📥 Get results (like ResultSet for SELECT queries).
            ⚙️ Handle database tasks from Java code.
```
