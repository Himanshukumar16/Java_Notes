Why Use Hibernate?
```
Simplifies database CRUD operations.
Reduces boilerplate JDBC code.
Prevents SQL injection via parameterized queries.
Works well with enterprise Java frameworks (Spring, JPA).
```

Key Features of Hibernate :

| Feature                             | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** | Maps Java classes to database tables automatically.                       |
| **Automatic SQL Generation**        | Reduces the need to write SQL manually — Hibernate generates it for you.  |
| **Database Independence**           | Code is largely DBMS-independent — switch databases with minimal changes. |
| **Caching**                         | Built-in caching improves performance by reducing database calls.         |
| **Lazy Loading**                    | Loads data only when it's needed, improving performance.                  |
| **Transaction Management**          | Supports atomic transactions with automatic rollback on failure.          |
| **Annotations/XML Configuration**   | Flexible configuration using annotations or XML files.                    |
